- 👋 Hi, I’m @nafishachoudhury
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C Programming at Metropolitan University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner open-source projects and contribute in any parts possible.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know anything about programming but still want to work with Elon Musk in the future, So I figured the only way possible is to know Computer Engineering.
